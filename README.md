## Getting Started

It is recommended to use Yarn to avoid dependency collisions: [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-ethereum-starter.git
cd nextjs-ethereum-starter

yarn install

# Start up the Hardhat Network
yarn chain
```

Here we just install the npm project's dependencies, and by running `yarn chain` we spin up an instance of Hardhat Network that you can connect to using MetaMask. In a different terminal in the same directory, run:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This will deploy the contract to Hardhat Network. After this completes run:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
```

This will install the frontend packages. We also need to set up the local configuration file.

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

This will create a file called `.env.local`. Open up that file and fill in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=` environment variables.

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start up the Next.js development server. Your site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

To interact with the local contract, be sure to switch your MetaMask Network to `Localhost 8545`
